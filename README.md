# HTML-FOUNDATIONS

## Basics of HTML & CSS

**HTML and CSS** are two of the *foundational building blocks* of pretty much everything on the web, two languages that work together to create everything you see on the Internet.

**HTML** and **CSS** are two of the *building blocks* of Web Development.

**HTML** provides **structure and meaning** to our text: it creates all the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons; it puts information on a webpage<br>
**CSS** adds **style** to those plain elements: gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!


## In-depth

**HTML** (*HyperText Markup Language*)<br>
A fundamental **markup language** that determines the **structure** and **content** of a web page.<br>
This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia.<br>
It is able to create: paragraphs, lists, headings, layout, links, multimedia players, forms, tables and many more elements.

**CSS** (*Cascading Style Sheets*)<br>
Popular **style sheet language** used for specifying **styling** and **presentation** of a document written in a **markup language** as HTML.<br>
Used to style the content of a web page, it lets developers control the visual appearance of websites through typographic characteristics, colour properties, and overall layout of web pages.

**The relation between HTML and CSS** is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.


## Terms of relevance

**Hypertext**<br>
Text (often with embeds such as images, too) displayed on a web page or in a document which contains links to other information, making it possible **to navigate between different content** in a nonlinear way.<br>

**Programming language**<br>
Formal language containing a set of instructions, written by programmers, that **enables humans to communicate with computers**, creating the technology we use every day; telling them what to do, computers are able to perform and accomplish tasks and get the desired outputs.<br>Like spoken languages, each language has its own unique syntax, structure, vocabulary, and even slang or shortcuts.
These languages enable us to build, organize and share code, process large amounts of data, specify functionality and behavior, automate and improve efficiency, and solve problems creatively.

**Cascading**<br>
In web development this word refers to **how styles are applied to HTML elements**; a top-down definition of styles where newer styles override previous styles.<br>
CSS rules can be defined in multiple places (inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets) so the term “cascading” highlights how CSS applies a hierarchy of rules, where certain rules take precedence over others based on defined principles.

**CSS Cascading order precedence** from highest priority to lowest one:

**Inline CSS >  Internal CSS > External CSS > Browser Default/User Styles**

**Style sheet language**<br>
It's a computer language that **describes the appearance and layout** of a web page written in HTML. It contains the style rules that determine how elements on the page should be displayed.
